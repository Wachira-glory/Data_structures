A tupple is a sequence of comma separated values enclosed in a parenthesis
Properties of a tuple
Ordered: They keep the elements in the same order.
Immutable: Once created, they cannot be altered.
Permit duplicates: They may have more than one value.
Representation:The values are listed in a comma separated way.
Data types:Tuples hold different data types such as integers, strings, floats.


Applications of a tuple
Immutable data storage.When data should not be altered or does not need to be modified, tuples are used to hold a fixed collection of values that never change.
Dictionaries keys.Tuples are useful for creating dictionary keys when you need to combine more than one piece of data into your key, especially when you want to use an array of elements as dictionary keys.
Efficient data structures.Tuples are memory-efficient and faster than lists, making them suitable for scenarios where a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements is required, and where immutability is desired.


Advantages of a tuple
Compared to lists, they use less memory since they don't need additional space to store the size and capacity of the list.
Because they require less memory than lists, they can access and iterate over their elements more quickly.
Since they cannot be altered once produced, they offer an extra layer of security that can be helpful in ensuring that data is not altered maliciously or unintentionally.

Disadvantages of a tuple
It is more difficult to add to or remove from them since they are immutable.
They can often be less convenient to work with than lists since they lack some of the built-in methods and functions that lists have.
