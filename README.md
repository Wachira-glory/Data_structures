# Heaps
A heap is a complete binary  tree- based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where the root node is always largest or smallest among all the other nodes depending on the heap type.
There are two types of heaps:max-heap and min-heap
Max-heap:The key at the root node of a Max-Heap must be greater than or equal to the key at each of its offspring.
Min-heap:The key at the root node of a Min-Heap must be less than or equal to the key at each of its offspring.
